# CalculatorProject
the first **full stack project** that has been done by me
it is implemented as a mix between _windows_ and _android_ calculator; where it can display the results for you without pressing on **=** but
the result does not follow the _mathematical presedence of operations_ it goes sequentially as in _windows_
it was the first assignment in _programming II : OOP & Design patterns_ course
as you see it includes both the front-end and back-end parts
front-end was implemented on **Angular** framework
back-end was implemented on **springboot** framework
